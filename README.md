# Linear Regression Analysis on mtcars Dataset

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression analysis using R and the built-in `mtcars` dataset. The goal is to explore the relationship between **horsepower (hp)** and **miles per gallon (mpg)**, and visualize the results with a scatter plot and regression line.

## 📊 Project Overview

- Load and inspect the `mtcars` dataset
- Generate summary statistics
- Create a scatter plot of `hp` vs `mpg`
- Fit a linear regression model: `mpg ~ hp`
- Visualize the regression line
- Interpret model output

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- R programming language
- Base R functions (`lm`, `plot`, `summary`)
- Kaggle Notebooks

## 📁 Files

- `mtcars_analysis.R`: Main script containing the analysis
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git


- Open the .R file in RStudio or run it in a Kaggle R notebook.
- View the plot and model summary in the output.
